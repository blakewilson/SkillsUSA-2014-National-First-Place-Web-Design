# Gold Medal for SkillsUSA National Web Design 2014

This was the website my partner and I build in Kansas City for the SkillsUSA National web design competition in 2014.

We were unable to use an internet connection and were provided assets and libraries like FontAwesome and the images you see on the website.

We were given 8 hours to successfully build a website for a client "WebProfessionals.org". This competition challenged our HTML, CSS, and JS skills. Feel free to take a look at the source code!
