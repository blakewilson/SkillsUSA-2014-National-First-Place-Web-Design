    	<div id="primary" class="primary-content">
    	  <p>The world is overrun with people who are ‘good’ at what they do. People get used to the motions and sometimes forget what great actually means. </p>
    	  <p>Web Design is no different than any field in the world. There are a lot of people who design web sites for a living, but what really sets them apart from the rest of the pack?</p>
    	  <p>Soon, the sites of the world will be overrun with the same stuff we see over and over again. We need to risk takers and bold thinkers. People who aren’t afraid to try something new and innovate through creativity.</p>
    	  <p>We want to make the world’s next best thinkers. The go-getters, who get hired because of their designs and even more important their attitude.</p>
    	  <p>So many designers who have come in and out of the SkillsUSA and soon Web Design Contest, have gone on to be those innovators.</p>
    	  <p>Don’t be afraid to try something new and especially don’t be afraid to stray away from the pack a little, who knows, you may end up being the worlds next best designer. One way to get there is through our contest, so get studying and thinking!</p>
